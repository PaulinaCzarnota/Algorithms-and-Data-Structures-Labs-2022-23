This repository contains a collection of my Algorithms and Data Structures labs, completed during my second year of Computer Science at TU Dublin. The labs demonstrate various data structures and algorithm implementations, all developed in Java.

### Lab Overview:

- **Lab 1:** StackTest – Implementation and testing of the stack data structure.
- **Lab 2:** QueueTest – Implementation and testing of the queue data structure.
- **Lab 3:** Heap and QueueTest2 – Implementation of heaps and additional queue functionalities.
- **Lab 4:** Heap – In-depth exploration and implementation of the heap data structure.
- **Lab 5:** Sorted Linked List (SortedLL), Sorted Doubly Linked List (SortedDLL), and Heapsort – Implementation of sorted linked lists and the Heapsort algorithm.

This collection showcases my understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms, demonstrating both theoretical knowledge and practical coding skills.
